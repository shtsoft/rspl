# PELICAN

This example implements a PEdestrians-LIight-CONtrolled (pelican) crossing (almost) as suggested
in [Introduction Hierarchical State Machines](https://barrgroup.com/embedded-systems/how-to/introduction-hierarchical-state-machines).
There, they describe an implementation of a pelican crossing as hierarchical state machine in C using techniques from OOP.
This example adapts these techniques specifically to rspl and Rust yielding a corresponding implementation in Rust.

The intention of the example is to demonstrate rspl's applicability in event-driven programming (with hierarchical state machines, of course).

Now that we have said what we are going to implement and why, let us explain our techniques before presenting the code, applying those techniques.
To this end, we split the following discussion into three parts.
First, we introduce the general design pattern of encoding state machines in rspl.
After that, we address the problem of how to deal with the hierarchy aspect in Rust.
Both is done without referring to the specific example of the pelican crossing.
Then, third and last, before discussing the actual pelican code in place we briefly discuss the code's overall structure.\
So, first, rspl's stream processors can encode finite state machines in a way reminiscent of the (type-)state pattern: every machine state is represented as a stream processor which behaves on the input as the transition function of the machine in that state.
This works because rspl is somewhat CPS-ish in the sense that every stream processor has the one for further processing encoded in its arguments.\
On top, stream processors have two properties making it possible to generalize the domain of the design pattern in a natural way.
On the one hand, stream processors are able to output something and hence allow to even encode Mealy machines.
On the other hand, stream processors can have side effects expanding the domain by effectful machines.\
Now, while it is nice to be able to encode effectful (Mealy) machines instead of only ordinary finite state machines, having the effect implementations baked into the machine can be unfavorable for reasons of modularity and control.[^1]
To mitigate those problems, a possible approach is to reflect all possible effects into the stream processor's output type.
Then, the effects become a stream of capabilities the machine requires the operator to provide in order to make progress.
This improves modularity since the machine logic is seperated from its side effects.
Moreover, an operator decides how to operate the machine further when an effect occurs and thus makes control more explicit.
Generally, the approach is in analogy to effect handlers.\
After having introduced the design pattern for state machines let us address the hierarchy aspect next.
First, note that state machines have a deficiency w.r.t. the DRY-principle: if there are several - let us say n - states which transition on a certain input to a certain state, then a naive implementation of the transition function repeats some code n times.
For large state machines, as in event-driven programming, this can be a problem.
The solution is to use hierarchical state machines which organize the states in a tree rather than a list.
The n states from above would then have a common ancestor from which they can inherit the implementation of the shared behavior.\
Now Rust's inheritance features are scarce and do not natively apply to the problem at discourse.
But Rust's local functions, shadowing properties and macros can do the hierarchy-trick in rspl's stream processor approach to state machines.
Namely, because function definitions can be arbitrarily nested, one can encode trees whose nodes hold a list of function definitions which are accessible from the node itself and its descendants.
Furthermore, nodes can effectively redefine functions already defined in ancestors by shadowing.
This manifests itself in the fact that a call to a function refers to the first implementation encountered when walking up the tree (which coincides with the lexically closest definition).
On the whole, using local functions in such a way reflects OOP with the usual inheritance, though in a somewhat cumbersome manner.
The point now is that the definition of states in our approach is via 'global elements' of stream processors, that is, via functions with no arguments which output a stream processor.
So, it is clear how to implement a hierarchy of states.
But it is also clear how to share transition behavior: just define a function carrying the implementation to be shared within the appropriate node.
This is particularly useful if the actual transition is a pattern match on the input of the machine where the match arms call the lexically closest function with the name of the pattern.
This idea of always capturing the right function for each case can then be abstracted away by a `case-capture` macro, finally completing the hack for hierarchy.\
Last but not least, let us have a look at the structure of our pelican crossing implementation.
Essentially, it consists of three parts: a module encapsulating the machine logic of the pelican crossing, a driver-function responsible for providing the pelican crossing's capabilities and a main-function simulating the input and setting up the driver for the pelican crossing.
Here, the machine logic mainly determines when it needs which capability like resetting the actual lights or feeding back an event by processing the event stream.
The driver then executes the actions like resetting the lights or feeding back an event by need.

Let us now walk through the code together.

The closing remarks shall just outline possible future work on event-driven programming with rspl: one thing which is conceivable is to develop some sort of domain-specific language helping with implementing arbitrary hierarchical state machines.
It could consist of only some clever macros, but it could also be something more sophisticated like an UML-like language which is compiled to Rust with rspl.
Another - admittedly somewhat more fantastical - possibility is a library of generic rspl-encoded machines which can be specialized by client code according to their needs by providing capabilities.
