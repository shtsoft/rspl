//! rspl is a stream-processor language based on the one discussed in [Generalising Monads to Arrows](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167642399000234) using Rust as meta-language.
//!
//! ## Design
//!
//! Essentially, rspl is a way to encode functions from streams to streams such that control is syntactically explicit (like in ordinary continuation-passing style) refining the orthodox functional approach to stream processing with combinators like 'map'.
//! More precisely, the idea of this stream-processor language is to split the processing of streams into two parts:
//! One part for reading (getting) the first element of an input stream to direct the further processing.
//! Another part for writing (putting) something to the output stream and offering to process some input stream if needed.
//! Combining these parts in various ways allows to flexibly construct stream processors as programs.
//! The following graphic illustrates how those two different kinds of stream processors ('getting' and 'putting') work (whereas a textual description is contained in the docs of [`StreamProcessor`]):
//!
//! <pre>
//! h--t1--t2--t3--...                   ha--t1--t2--t3--...
//! -                                    -
//! |                                    |
//! | Get(h |-> [SP](h))                 | Put(hb, LAZY-[SP])
//! |                                    |
//! v                                    |
//! t1--t2--t3--...                      |   t1--t2--t3--...
//! -                                    |   -
//! |                                    v   |
//! | [SP](h) = Get(_)                   hb--| LAZY-[SP]() = Get(_)
//! |                                        |
//! v                                        v
//! ...                                      ...
//!
//!
//! h--t1--t2--t3--...                   ha--t1--t2--t3--...
//! -                                    -
//! |                                    |
//! | Get(h |-> [SP](h))                 | Put(hb, LAZY-[SP])
//! |                                    |
//! v                                    |
//! h--t1--t2--t3--...                   |   ha--t1--t2--t3--...
//! -                                    |   -
//! |                                    v   |
//! | [SP](h) = Put(_, _)                hb--| LAZY-[SP]() = Put(_, _)
//! |                                        |
//! v                                        v
//! ...                                      ...
//! </pre>
//!
//! Remarkably, the language constructs are somewhat dual and loosely correspond to (dual) programming paradigms:
//! - The `Get`-construct relates to event-driven programming as it reacts to input (events) eagerly.
//! - The `Put`-construct relates to demand-driven[^1] programming as it generates output (demands) iteratively by need.
//!
//! This will be discussed further in the [Examples](#examples)-section.
//!
//! ## Usage
//!
//! To program a rspl-[`StreamProcessor`] you just have to compose the constructors [`StreamProcessor::Get`]/[`get`](`StreamProcessor::get`) and [`StreamProcessor::Put`]/[`put`](`StreamProcessor::put`) in the right way.
//! For a somewhat more high-level programming experience you might wish to look at the [`combinators`]-module.
//! The program can then be evaluated with the [`eval`](`StreamProcessor::eval`)-method on some kind of input stream.
//! The 'kind' of input stream is either your own implementation of the [`Stream`]-interface or one
//! from the submodules of the [`streams`]-module.
//! Either way, as result, evaluation produces an [`InfiniteList`] (lazily).
//! To observe streams - and i.p. infinite lists - you can destruct them with the [`head`](`Stream::head`)- and [`tail`](`Stream::tail`)-methods of the stream interface.
//! Moreover, there are various functions helping with the destruction and construction of streams.
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! As alluded to in the [Design](#design)-section, rspl supports orthodox 'combinator-driven' stream processing as it is known from list processing with combinators like [`compose`](`combinators::compose`), [`filter`](`combinators::filter`) and [`map`](`combinators::map`).
//! For example, it is possible to first filter some 'bad' elements out of a stream in order to safely iterate some function over the resulting stream afterwards in a combinatorial way.
//! Such a [usage](#usage) of rspl looks like:
//!
//! ```
//! use rspl::combinators::{compose, filter, map};
//! use rspl::streams::infinite_lists::InfiniteList;
//! use rspl::streams::Stream;
//! use rspl::StreamProcessor;
//!
//! let is_greater_zero = |n: &usize| *n > 0;
//! let minus_one = |n: usize| n - 1;
//!
//! let zeroes = compose(filter(is_greater_zero), map(minus_one))
//!     .eval(InfiniteList::cons(0, || InfiniteList::constant(1)));
//!
//! assert_eq!(*zeroes.head(), 0);
//! ```
//!
//! More interestingly, rspl can also serve as a framework for the nifty idea of
//! - event-driven programming with state machines as suggested [here](https://barrgroup.com/Embedded-Systems/How-To/State-Machines-Event-Driven-Systems).
//!   Abstractly, that [usage](#usage) of rspl looks as follows:
//!
//!   ```
//!   use rspl::streams::infinite_lists::InfiniteList;
//!   use rspl::streams::Stream;
//!   use rspl::StreamProcessor;
//!
//!   #[derive(Copy, Clone)]
//!   enum Event {
//!       Event1,
//!       Event2,
//!   }
//!
//!   fn action() -> bool {
//!       true
//!   }
//!
//!   fn state_1<'a>() -> StreamProcessor<'a, Event, bool> {
//!       fn transition<'a>(event: Event) -> StreamProcessor<'a, Event, bool> {
//!           match event {
//!               Event::Event1 => StreamProcessor::put(action(), state_1),
//!               Event::Event2 => state_2(),
//!           }
//!       }
//!
//!       StreamProcessor::get(transition)
//!   }
//!
//!   fn state_2<'a>() -> StreamProcessor<'a, Event, bool> {
//!       fn transition<'a>(event: Event) -> StreamProcessor<'a, Event, bool> {
//!           match event {
//!               Event::Event1 => state_1(),
//!               Event::Event2 => StreamProcessor::put(false, state_2),
//!           }
//!       }
//!
//!       StreamProcessor::get(transition)
//!   }
//!
//!   let event_loop = state_2().eval(InfiniteList::constant(Event::Event1));
//!
//!   assert!(event_loop.head());
//!   ```
//!
//!   A slightly more concrete example using that pattern is available as [integration test](https://github.com/shtsoft/rspl/blob/master/tests/events.rs).
//!   And a full-blown concrete example of a pelican crossing can be found [here (as .md file)](https://github.com/shtsoft/rspl/blob/master/examples/pelican.md) and [here (as .rs file)](https://github.com/shtsoft/rspl/blob/master/examples/pelican.rs).
//!   Notably, it uses rspl to encode effectful hierarchical state machines with a capability-passing inspired effect-handling mechanism.
//! - demand-driven programming with generators as suggested [here](https://www.cse.chalmers.se/~rjmh/Papers/whyfp.pdf).
//!   Abstractly, that [usage](#usage) of rspl looks as follows:
//!
//!   ```
//!   use rspl::streams::infinite_lists::InfiniteList;
//!   use rspl::streams::Stream;
//!   use rspl::StreamProcessor;
//!
//!   struct State {
//!       toggle: bool,
//!   }
//!
//!   fn action(state: &mut State) {
//!       state.toggle = !state.toggle;
//!   }
//!
//!   fn pre_action(state: State) -> State {
//!       state
//!   }
//!
//!   fn post_action(state: State) -> State {
//!       state
//!   }
//!
//!   fn generator_name<'a>(mut state: State) -> StreamProcessor<'a, (), bool> {
//!       state = pre_action(state);
//!       StreamProcessor::get(|_| {
//!           action(&mut state);
//!           StreamProcessor::put(state.toggle, || generator_name(post_action(state)))
//!       })
//!   }
//!
//!   let generations = generator_name(State { toggle: false }).eval(InfiniteList::constant(()));
//!
//!   assert!(generations.head());
//!   ```
//!
//!   A slightly more concrete example using that pattern is available as [integration test](https://github.com/shtsoft/rspl/blob/master/tests/demands.rs).
//!   And a full-blown concrete example of a heat index control system can be found [here (as .md file)](https://github.com/shtsoft/rspl/blob/master/examples/hics.md) and [here (as .rs file)](https://github.com/shtsoft/rspl/blob/master/examples/hics.rs).
